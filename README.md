# Datavizualisation_project
In this repository is a project of data visualization done during my studies at the UWS. My coworker and I chose to analyze the price of houses from a dataset obtained from
Kaggle.

See report.pdf for relevant vizualisations, full explanation and conclusions of the analyze.

All code for visualizations is available in the Exploration notebook :)
